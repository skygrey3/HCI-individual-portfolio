# HCI-individual-portfolio
A portfolio containing all the HCI workshops from week 1-7.

## Accessing the Portfolio
All the work is showcased on the web page (index.html) through embeds and/or links.<br/>

All Figma projects have a share link, which can be accessed by clicking on the "Link to figma project" button.<br/>

If the links are not working, all of the figma project files and documents can also be found in the "figma-projects" folder and "documents" folder respectively.
